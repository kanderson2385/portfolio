# CI/CD Pipeline Sample Project 

This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD 
pipeline using GitLab CI/CD. It covers the 
basics of build, test, and deploy stages. 

## Pipeline Overview

the CI/CD pipeline, containing: 
- **Build Stage**: Compiling the
application.
- **Test Stage**: Running tests to verify
- functionality.
- **Deploy Stage**: Simulating deployment.
